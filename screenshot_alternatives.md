# Screenshot Alternatives for Ubuntu Server

Since we need sudo to install a headless browser, here are your options:

## Option 1: Install Chromium (Requires sudo)
Run the install script I created:
```bash
sudo bash install_headless_browser.sh
```

## Option 2: Use Docker (Requires sudo for initial setup)
```bash
# Pull a browser container
docker run -v $(pwd):/screenshots alpeware/chrome-headless-trunk \
  --headless --disable-gpu --screenshot=/screenshots/site.png \
  http://host.docker.internal:8000
```

## Option 3: Use an Online Service
We could use a free screenshot API service to capture the site if it's publicly accessible.

## Option 4: Manual Screenshot Upload
You could take screenshots manually on your local machine and upload them to the server for me to analyze.

## Option 5: Use wget with page2images (Python)
```bash
# Install Python package (might work without sudo if using pip --user)
pip3 install --user html2image

# Or use playwright (more complex but powerful)
pip3 install --user playwright
playwright install chromium
```

## What to do now:

1. **If you have sudo access**: Run `sudo bash install_headless_browser.sh`
2. **If no sudo**: Let me know and we can try the Python pip --user approach
3. **If site is public**: We could use an online screenshot service

Which option would you prefer?
