Privileged Draft – For Internal Counsel Review
Role: LexPro (GC/Regulatory & DPO) — advisory & assessment only; product decisions remain with owners.

1) Context & Goal

You said you implemented Block‑8 follow‑ups and uploaded a fresh evidence bundle. I performed a deterministic, read‑only review of the uploaded ZIP and validated the assertions.

Input reviewed: /mnt/data/AAA.zip → evidence folder detected at:
/mnt/data/review_legal_pub_v2/AAA (contains legal_pages.txt, imprint_has_*, privacy_has_*, cookie_no_analytics.txt, security_*, and the new presence checks like open_source_present.txt, accessibility_present.txt, etc.)

Output: PASS/FAIL audit report and a one‑line surgical fix if needed.

⸻

2) Results (evidence‑based)

PASS / FAIL summary: 24 PASS, 1 FAIL.

All core “Must” items show as implemented (PASS):
	•	Legal index listed (/legal/index.html).
	•	Privacy, Cookies, Website Terms, Imprint listed.
	•	Imprint content has: Valfox Ltd registered name, Company number label, Registered office label, “England & Wales” jurisdiction.
	•	Privacy content has: Controller (Valfox Ltd), legitimate interests legal basis, ICO complaint route, link to Cookie Policy, retention signal (emails/logs).
	•	Cookie Policy declares no analytics.
	•	security.txt has Contact and Expires; contact domain is @equilens.io; expiry parses and is in the future.
	•	Hygiene: No forms, no external scripts under /legal/.

Block‑8 additions (all PASS):
	•	Open‑Source Notices (summary) present.
	•	Accessibility page present.
	•	DPA Position (public summary) present.
	•	Responsible‑Use page present.
	•	Trust Center index present.

Single FAIL (minor):
	•	L‑04b – ToS governing law (England & Wales): evidence file tos_has_governing_law.txt is empty/missing.

⸻

3) Artifacts (download)
	•	Full audit table (CSV): website_legal_audit_report_v2.csv
	•	Evidence folder found at: /mnt/data/review_legal_pub_v2/AAA
	•	Summary printed by the verifier: {'FAIL': 1, 'PASS': 24}

⸻

4) Surgical change‑set (one‑liner fix)

File: legal/tos.html
Add a governing‑law sentence (anywhere in the Terms body; footer is fine):

<p><strong>Governing law and jurisdiction:</strong> These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

	•	Impact: Low | Lanes touched: Web only | Rollback: remove the line if policy changes.
	•	If you prefer non‑exclusive jurisdiction, replace “exclusive” with “non‑exclusive”.

If you already have similar wording, ensure the exact phrasing includes “England and Wales” (our regex looks for “Governing law … England” or “England & Wales / England and Wales”).

⸻

5) Re‑verify (deterministic)

Run your updated scripts/legal/verify.sh or, if you want to mirror my checks, ensure these files are (re)generated with content:

tos_has_governing_law.txt      # should now be non-empty after the fix

Acceptance after fix:
	•	All files under evidence folder show PASS; specifically, tos_has_governing_law.txt has at least one match line.

⸻

6) Risk & Rollback

Item	Risk if omitted	Impact	Rollback
Governing‑law clause in ToS	Ambiguity on applicable law/venue	Low	Remove or edit clause text


⸻

7) Follow‑ups (optional polish; non‑blocking)
	•	If your pages already include noindex meta and skip‑link accessibility hooks (as you noted), consider adding tiny assertions for those in your verify script (not mandatory).
	•	If you publish an SBOM link on /legal/open‑source.html, ensure the link target is stable (even if access is “on request”).

⸻

8) Assumptions & Independence
	•	I reviewed evidence only; I did not fetch or render your live site or raw HTML.
	•	DPO advice only; owners decide publication.
	•	No secrets/PII disclosed; corporate identifiers are treated as public.

⸻

TL;DR

Everything requested in Block‑8 now passes except a simple ToS governing‑law assertion. Add the one‑line clause above, rerun your verify script, and the bundle should be green across the board.
