Privileged Draft – For Internal Counsel Review
Role: LexPro (GC/Regulatory & DPO) — advisory & assessment only; product decisions remain with owners.

⸻

1) What I reviewed
	•	Your uploaded evidence bundle: /mnt/data/LEGAL-PUB-LEGAL-PUB-v1.zip.
	•	I extracted and assessed the contents of the folder LEGAL-PUB-LEGAL-PUB-v1/ inside the zip (evidence files like legal_pages.txt, privacy_has_*, imprint_has_*, security_*, etc.).

Important: The bundle contains evidence files (assertion outputs), not the website pages themselves. I therefore evaluated from the evidence artifacts you generated, not by reading the site HTML directly.

⸻

2) Summary (EU/UK website legal set)

Result: Evidence indicates you’ve implemented the core “Must” pages and content (Privacy, Cookies, ToS, Imprint, security.txt) and satisfied the key assertions we requested.
	•	PASS (evidence):
	•	legal_pages.txt lists: legal/privacy.html, legal/cookie-policy.html, legal/tos.html, legal/imprint.html, plus legal/index.html, legal/export.html.
	•	Imprint content present: registered name, “Company number” label, “Registered office” label, and “England & Wales” jurisdiction (imprint_has_* files all present).
	•	Privacy content present: controller (Valfox) named, legitimate interests, ICO complaint route, link to Cookie Policy (privacy_has_* files present).
	•	Cookie Policy states no analytics (cookie_no_analytics.txt).
	•	security.txt present with Contact: mailto and Expires in ISO‑8601 format, and the contact uses @equilens.io; expiry is in the future.
	•	Hygiene: Evidence shows no <form> and no external <script src="http…"> in /legal/.
	•	Gaps / deltas vs your spec:
	•	R‑03 Open‑Source Notices (summary) — not listed in legal_pages.txt. Your spec marked this Must (summary).
	•	Recommended pages not listed: Accessibility (L‑06), DPA Position (R‑01), Responsible‑Use (L‑08), Trust Center index (R‑02).
	•	(Optional robustness) No assertion yet that ToS includes governing law = England & Wales; consider adding this check to your evidence script.

3) Evidence reports (download)
	•	Evidence‑based audit report (PASS on all checks we evaluated):
Download CSV

(Note: I also ran a separate presence scan that expects the raw HTML files inside the bundle; that’s not authoritative here because your upload contains only the evidence, not the pages.)

⸻

4) Surgical fixes to reach full spec compliance

Priority 1 — Complete “Must” set
	•	Add /legal/open-source.html (R‑03, Must). Keep it a summary: link to SBOM and reproduce NOTICE excerpts where required (e.g., Apache‑2.0). Minimal seed:

<h1>Open‑Source Notices</h1>
<p>This site/product uses open‑source software. Licences and attributions are listed in our SBOM (download link). Where a component’s licence requires reproduction of a NOTICE file, the relevant text is included below.</p>



Priority 2 — Recommended pages (good practice)
	•	Accessibility (L‑06): simple WCAG 2.1 AA intent + “reasonable adjustments” contact route.
	•	DPA Position (R‑01): short public summary that we are not a processor for the appliance’s customer data; DPA on request.
	•	Responsible‑Use (L‑08): short boundaries; self‑hosted; no data leaves us.
	•	Trust Center (R‑02): summaries only; artefacts on request/NDA.

5) Verification script — tiny patch (add checks; no rewrites)

Append these to your legal‑evidence script to capture the remaining signals deterministically:

# R-03 Open-Source Notices presence (Must)
[ -f legal/open-source.html ] && echo OK > "$BASE/open_source_present.txt" || echo MISSING > "$BASE/open_source_present.txt"

# L-06 Accessibility presence (Should)
[ -f legal/accessibility.html ] && echo OK > "$BASE/accessibility_present.txt" || echo MISSING > "$BASE/accessibility_present.txt"

# R-01 DPA Position presence (Should)
[ -f legal/dpa-position.html ] && echo OK > "$BASE/dpa_position_present.txt" || echo MISSING > "$BASE/dpa_position_present.txt"

# L-08 Responsible-Use presence (Should)
[ -f legal/responsible-use.html ] && echo OK > "$BASE/responsible_use_present.txt" || echo MISSING > "$BASE/responsible_use_present.txt"

# R-02 Trust Center index presence (Should)
[ -f trust-center/index.html ] && echo OK > "$BASE/trust_center_present.txt" || echo MISSING > "$BASE/trust_center_present.txt"

# ToS governing law (E&W) — robustness check (optional)
rg -n "Governing\\s+law.*England|England\\s*&\\s*Wales|England\\s+and\\s+Wales" legal/tos.html > "$BASE/tos_has_governing_law.txt" || true

# Privacy retention mention (optional)
rg -n "Retention|retained|rotate" legal/privacy.html > "$BASE/privacy_has_retention.txt" || true

Acceptance criterion updates:
	•	Evidence bundle now should include:
open_source_present.txt (OK), and where implemented: accessibility_present.txt, dpa_position_present.txt, responsible_use_present.txt, trust_center_present.txt, plus ToS governing law match and Privacy retention signal.

⸻

6) Risk & rollback
	•	Open‑source notices missing (R‑03) → licence attribution risk (esp. Apache‑2.0 NOTICE).
	•	Impact: Low | Lanes: Web only | Rollback: Add page; remove if policy changes.
	•	Recommended pages absent → no legal breach, but trust friction.
	•	Impact: Low | Rollback: Add later with one‑page stubs.
	•	ToS governing law not asserted → ambiguity risk; easy to fix via one line.
	•	Impact: Low | Rollback: Edit text.

⸻

7) Follow‑ups (owner inputs)
	•	Confirm log retention period (e.g., 30 days) for Privacy Notice.
	•	Confirm hosting/CDN provider names to keep “recipients” accurate.
	•	Provide company number and registered office address (already evidenced as labels; ensure values are correct in the page).
	•	Confirm no analytics/third‑party scripts remain true post‑launch; if that changes, deploy CMP before activation.

⸻

8) Assumptions & independence
	•	I validated only what your evidence bundle asserts. I did not open your actual HTML pages or any live site.
	•	DPO advice only; publication decisions remain with Valfox.
	•	No secrets/PII were printed; company info is treated as public corporate data.

⸻

TL;DR
	•	Good work: All core “Must” assertions in evidence PASS (Privacy, Cookies, ToS, Imprint, security.txt; hygiene clean).
	•	Do next: Add Open‑Source Notices page (R‑03, Must), and (optionally) the recommended pages.
	•	Artifacts: Evidence‑based results here — download CSV.
	•	Keep the script tiny: apply the patch in §5 to lock in the remaining checks. ￼
