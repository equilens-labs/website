Backlog batch:
- Make repo default robots.txt private-by-default (Disallow) to match deploy default.
- Remove Google Fonts @import (blocked by CSP; avoids third-party dependency).
- Expand Pa11y/LHCI URL coverage to include /fl-bsa/ and /trust-center/.
- Update tasks/Backlog.md to reflect current production snapshot and mark completed items.

Validation:
- pa11y-ci against 5 URLs (local server).
- lhci autorun against 5 URLs (local server).
- Production spot-check: robots.txt and meta robots present.
