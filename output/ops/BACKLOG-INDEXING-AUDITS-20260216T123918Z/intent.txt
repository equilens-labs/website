Intent: Evidence bundle for BACKLOG indexing/audits fixes.

What was checked:
- Pa11y CI (WCAG2AA) against 5 local URLs (http://localhost:8080/*).
- Lighthouse CI against the same 5 URLs.
- Production snapshot checks for robots/meta-robots/sitemap behavior.
- Git whitespace check for origin/main...subject_head.

Attestation model:
- This bundle attests to the PR's non-evidence file contents via subject_sha256.txt.
- It does not attempt to self-attest to the git commit that contains this bundle.

How to verify:
- Compare subject_sha256.txt against the working tree for the listed subject_files.
- Identify the commit that introduced this bundle with:
  git log -1 --format=%H -- output/ops/BACKLOG-INDEXING-AUDITS-20260216T123918Z
