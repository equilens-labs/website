Address review findings for public artifact links:
- Pin website links to a fixed public release tag (v4.0.3) instead of mutable /latest URLs.
- Refresh evidence provenance metadata to distinguish base main SHA from branch head at capture time.
- Minimize stored GitHub release metadata to only fields needed for reproducibility (no user profile payloads).
