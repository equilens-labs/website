Backlog P0 fix: GitHub Pages branch-mode deploy mismatch.

Change:
- In .github/workflows/pages.yml, the branch-mode publisher job now publishes the dist artifact produced in the build job (instead of re-checking out and rebuilding).
- Add actions: read permission for artifact download.

Expected effect:
- Branch-mode publishing ships the same dist/ output that includes SEO toggles, sitemap generation (public), OG render, and any PDF render outputs produced in the build job.
